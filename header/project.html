                    Cooperation between university and industry plays a crucial
                    role for skill development, employment opportunities for

                    addressed in Europe within the current 'Europe 2020

                    HR unit is progressed under Personnel Office to manage all

                    promotion once staffs applied for. Human Resource Management
                    is very important of each and every organization. Without

                    sustainable energy development in Cambodia, Laos and
                    Myanmar. The objective will have a direct link to
                    strengthening the integration of sustainable energy goals
                    into national level energy policies, provide qualified
                    energy experts into the local, national and regional labor
                    markets and foster greater collaboration between the
                    traditionally siloed public and private sectors and increase
                    regional level cooperation and mobility in research,
                    entrepreneurship and innovation. The possible direct short
                    term impacts include modernisation and internationalisation
                    of HEIs, and in long term the project will contribute to
                    sustainable energy policies, mitigation of climate GHG
                    emissions and climate change, energy security and better
                    access to energy for all.

                    Building in High Education) proposal whose main aim is to
                    enhance the research capacities of HEIs in the southeast
                    Asian region, by strengthening relationships between
                    Education, Research and Innovation in GIS, SDI and remote
                    sensing, for applications that are related to environment,
                    agriculture and situations of emergency. The project will
                    develop a common nexus between various actors of research
                    and innovation (HEIs, research centers, spin-off companies)
                    in Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia where specific
                    methodologies for innovation transfer are convergent with EU
                    developments in accordance with Europe 2020 strategy and
                    Smart specialisation initiatives which is a new engine to
                    boost R&amp;D growth and subsequently job opportunities and
                    business creation. This will improve the transfer of
                    innovation from universities to local and regional
                    enterprises, enhancing their innovation potential for
                    geodata use and generating new applied research.

                    Government public expenditure reduction is one of the many
                    challenges that Cambodian Higher Education System is facing.
                    Explosive growth in enrollment, difficulties to recruit and
                    retain highly qualified staff and obsolete facilities also
                    contribute to affect the quality of the education and

                    For these ASIAN countries, the industrial structure of the
                    economy is still at its beginning and is facing many
                    challenges with their education system. One of them is the
                    lack of expert education with corresponding skills to work
                    on new technology of automation in processing and
                    manufacturing system.
                    <b>ASEAN FACTORI 4.0</b> project is proposed to contribute
                    to this challenge by the design of a set of industrial
                    automation labs with a corresponding staff training program
                    to initiate the foundation of center of excellence in
                    automation in each institute, different kinds of pedagogical
                    process will be implemented to creative a network of
                    competencies among our partner countries following their
                    local needs and to permit cross learning approach during the
                    project. Through the industrial 4.0 roadmap, the project is
                    the first step to educate students to prepare a future

                    a beneficiary. Notwithstanding, the Communication and media
                    studies curriculum in the Asian HEIs seem to not
                    successfully match with the skills required for effective
                    sustainable development reporting in order to delivery the
                    2030 Agenda. The new courses will respond to the need for
                    modernization of curricula in journalism and media reporting
                    in the PC-HEIs, the need for journalist education with focus
                    on sustainable development as well as the need for strong
                    journalistic and pluralistic media system and the process of
                    sustainable development. The curriculum content is designed
                    to install the skills and level of data literacy necessary
                    to produce both short data stories on a deadline as well as
                    longer in-depth stories that explain underlying development
                    challenges facing the region through data and digital
                    storytelling. By choosing what is in a story, how the story
                    is told, and the diversity of stories, journalists and
                    editors have the capacity to enhance or limit the
                    information people will use to form opinions and make
                    decisions. Specifically, the objective pursued is in
                    department of Media and Communication of Faculty of Social
                    Science and Humanities of RUPP.<br /><br />

                    Entrepreneurship and Leadership/ ANGEL Effective :15 Jan
                    2021<br /><br />
                    A creation of strong network for green entrepreneurship and
                    transformational leadership can be a catalyst for innovation
                    and development as well as sustainable transformation (EU,
                    ASEAN, UNDP, UNESCO, OECD). ANGEL aims to build the capacity
                    necessary in eleven ASEAN Universities for balancing the
                    high potential economic growth and innovation in the partner
                    countries with their lack of capacities in green
                    entrepreneurship as well as resolving entrenched issues and
                    challenges of poverty, low quality jobs in the informal
                    sector, digital divide and leadership gaps.<br /><br />
                    Its objectives are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        - to address green entrepreneurship and transformational
                        leadership and social innovation challenges. The ASEAN
                        nations involved in this ANGEL project is at the lower
                        spectrum of innovation, high-tech sectors and effective
                        sanitation. Still, they have developed aspirations to
                        improve living conditions by moving from a subsistence
                        agricultural economy to commercial-based farming as well
                        as high-based technology and energy. This is where ANGEL
                        aims to create a difference in supporting such
                        transition economies in Lao PDR, Vietnam and Cambodia.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - to build a high calibre network of future green
                        entrepreneurial-leaders with effective and efficient
                        style of management who could uphold ethics and good
                        governance while able to connect with the local/regional
                        and international market ecosystem with a multiplier
                        effect in the ASEAN region. ANGEL takes issues of
                        leadership as a prime concern in order to improve
                        current institutional settings and professional
                        practices which in some contexts are laden with cases of
                        cronyism, corruptions and incompetence.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    Against the above general aims of ANGEL, the project
                    specifically designs the following objectives in the hope to
                    develop an innovative green entrepreneurial-leadership

                        complemented with personal coaching will support the
                        creation of start-ups.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        - Engagement: a university network will reach and
                        mobilize both internal and external stakeholders through

                        include faculty members, administrative staff,
                        researchers, students and relevant external partners
                        could be social entrepreneurs, start-ups and government
                        agencies that relates to green entrepreneurship). The
                        ANGEL- Innovate unit will orient learners to the process
                        of design thinking; effective and responsible
                        leadership, supporting grassroot green entrepreneurship

                        for the development of early-stage startups in green
                        technologies, energy and sustainable development; the
                        ANGEL-Site will provide all the information for the
                        development and visibility of startups; the
                        ANGEL-Community will connect all relevant parties in the
                        University and external stakeholders in exchanging
                        experiences and ideas.
